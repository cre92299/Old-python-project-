# Old-python-project-
I made this personal python project, it writes results into the results.txt. In the 'actions' dictionary, change 'action1-5' values, to something you like, maybe you could turn this into a check in sheet, every day it asks you how you feel 1 = bad 5 = amazing yada yada be creative :D,
